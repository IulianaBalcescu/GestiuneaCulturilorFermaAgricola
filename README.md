This project involved developing an agricultural resource management system using C++. 
It featured functionalities for monitoring and managing crops, as well as optimizing 
resource use, such as water and fertilizers. I applied object-oriented programming (OOP) 
concepts and used advanced data structures and algorithms to simulate and automate 
decision-making processes. The project demonstrated the practical application of 
programming in the agricultural sector and the integration of data and resource management components.
